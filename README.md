# Weather_Comparison_App

I made this weather comparison app to practice JavaScript and XMLHttpRequests.  It is based on a learning tutorial and not my original work.  I did, however, implement the skills I've learned through a backend development class to perfect this project and work through hurdles along the way.  It was a great learning experience working with third-party APIs, version control, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
